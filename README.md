# Upscaling-based-on-TgCNN
Project: Efficient upscaling of geologic model based on  theory-guided encoder-decoder<br>
* This is a course project for [Deep Generative Models](https://deep-generative-models.github.io/index2020.html).<br>
* This project trys to use the deep learning models to deal with the engineering problems in geological modeling.<br>
* This project trys to incorporate the physical laws into the training process of encoder-decoder and achieve unsupervised training.<br>
